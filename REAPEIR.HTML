  <h3>Electrical Service Types and Voltages</h3>
          <p>
            This application note describes various types of utility electrical services and supply
            voltages. The nominal system supply voltages listed below can vary by Â±10% or more.
            Measuring the phase-to-phase and phase-to-line voltages in the field is highly
            recommended to confirm the type of electrical service.

            Classification of Electrical Services

          </h3>
          <p>
            Alternating current (AC) electric power distribution systems can be classified by the
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Frequency: 50 Hz or 60 Hz
                </li>
                <li>Number of phases: single or three phase</li>
                <li>
                    Number of wires: 2, 3, or 4 (not counting the safety ground)
                </li>
                <li> Neutral present:</li>
                <li>Wye connected systems have a neutral</li>
                <li>Delta connected systems typically do not have a neutral</li>
                <li> Voltage levels:
                    <li>Low Voltage: 600 volts or less</li>
                    <li>Medium Voltage: 601 volts to about 34,500 volts</li>
                    <li>High Voltage: 46,000 volts and up</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
